# DietPlan
I want to solve the diet problem for Bob. 
Here's Bob's diet condition.

<pre>
Bob eats bread every day.
One day, he decides to go on a diet for "N" days.
He gains "C(i)"kg of weight when he eats bread on "i" day from the start of his diet plan.
Also, if he stops eating bread for a day, he can lose "A"kg of weight.

However, Bob feels stressed when he doesn't eat bread.
If he doesn't eat bread, the "stress point" will increase "1 point", and his weight will increase by "B * (stress point)" kg at the end of the day.
The "stress point" at the start of this diet plan is 0.
Also, every time after he eats bread, the stress point returns to 0.

Please note that on each day, his weight changes after a change in stress point.

If Bob's weight before the start of the diet plan is "W"kg, what is the minimum weight he can be in "N" days
</pre>
